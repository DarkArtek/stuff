Description:
------------

This is a Pygame port of the SDL water effect 
(http://www.libsdl.org/projects/water/index.html) by Scott Scriven. 

The original DOS source and supportting text file describing the implementation
of the effect are available from the URL above. I'd suggest reading through 
the text file first for a detailed explanation, or download the SDL version. 

All numeric optimisations in this port are by Pete Shinners. My original Python 
code is left in the comments so you can see what his optimisations are doing. 
Please note: this is not an exact port. The modifiers for lighting and water 
density have been omitted (easy addition for the user), the blob routine doesn't
attempt to smooth it's additions to the height map, and the surfer mode doesn't
attempt to follow the same sort of maths as the original! ;-) 

The keyboard controls to drive the demo are as follows:

"w" == turns on the rain
"s" == turns on the surfer
"b" == draws a large rain drop randomly on the screen

All modes will turn off the previous, and blob mode only draws one blob. You've 
got to keep pressing the key to draw more.

It's trivial to add modifiers to play with the lighting and density, although I 
agree with Scott, the defaults do look very nice. It'd also be fun to add mouse
controls to allow you to draw on the water, but that's left to you to add! ;-)
