      "# Interaction with a browser popup window\n",
      "\n",
      "This [IPython notebook](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/htmlnotebook.html) demonstrates the interaction between Python and a popup window that is opened via Javascript. The interaction is one-way in this case, from the notebook to the popup. We write data to the popup and call functions in the popup by executing Javascript from within the notebook. The goal is to demonstrate some simple interactions. In the end, I hope that techniques like these could be used for [livecoding](http://toplap.org/) in Python, with a HTML5 visualization window.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the notebook server and the HTML that we load in the popup must be located on the same domain. For this, we need to copy the [index.html](https://raw.github.com/pbouda/stuff/master/ipynb/index.html) to the root directory of the IPython server. Unfortunately, it is not easy to find out what the root directory is. The default is the home directory of the user, so if you didn't mess with your config just copy the html file to your home directory. If you changed your config you probably know whether you changed the root (it's the setting `ipython_dir`).\n",
